# Discovery-Scan-Entire-Subnet-Scan

I will demonstrate how to set up and run a discovery scan on an entire subnet range on tenable.io for a company

<h2>Requirements for this Lab</h2>

- <b> Simulated subnet range for a company </b>
- <b> Tenable.IO </b>

<p align="center">
Today, I will run a discovery scan against an entire subnet range for a company. The purpose of running discovery scans against an entire subnet range is to identify all active devices and hosts within that network.

<h2> 1. I will log onto Tenable so I can set up the scan. </h2>
<br /

<h3> I will navigate to the "Create a New Scan" section and select "Host Discovery Scan". </h3>

* Scans
* Create a New Scan 
* Host Discovery

<br />

I will now input all the necessary information for this scan.

I obtained the subnet range from Azure by navigating to the Virtual Networks section and retrieving the IP address.

I selected 
* Virtual Networks
* Settings
* Subnets

This is where I retrieved the IP range for the scan.

<h2> Now I will save and launch the scan. </h2>

<h3> Now I just have to wait for the results. </h3>
